# Important Concepts

- Every thing we place in a variable is object -> instance of class Except (null and if we enable sound null safety included in dart v2.12)

- Dart is strongly typed language but it can infer the types 
	- number is infered to be of type int.

- if null safety is enabled then variables cannot be nullable unless we mention it with ? tag

- Object? is used as a dynamic typed variable with null safety or Object without it.

- Generics are also supported like List<int> or List<Object>    

- Dart Supports top level functions such as  main function along with static and instance methods

- Dart also support top level variables tied to class or object (static,and instance variables) 

- dart does not have keywords such as public,protected and private

- if variable starts with _ it is private

- Dart has both expressions (which have runtime values) and statements (which donâ€™t).

- Dart has warnings and errors
